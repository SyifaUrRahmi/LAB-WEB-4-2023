          He is a member of the South Korean boy band, NCT. Mark is part of 3 NCT sub-units, 
          namely NCT U, NCT 127, and NCT Dream. Currently he is also a member of the super group SuperM.

          Height: 1.74 m, Nationality: Canadian, Music groups: NCT (since 2016), SuperM (since 2019), 
          NCT 127 (since 2016), others. Education: School of Performing Arts Seoul, 언주중 학교.
          I got to know the NCT group in 2021 when I was watching the Shopee Birthday event, 
          there I saw the NCT group performing the song Hello Future. because I like the song, 
          therefore I also started listening to other NCT songs. My bias in NCT is Mark Lee. 
          In my opinion, Mark Lee is a K-pop idol who really gives positive energy to his fans, 
          he always gives very real words of encouragement for life.
          it's not always easy, but that's life. Be strong because there are better days ahead - byMark
